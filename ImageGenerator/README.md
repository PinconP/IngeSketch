# ReadMe for ImageGenerator agent

This is by far the most complex and demanding agent of the project, it is basically the one that uses the diffusion model to generate images.

## Overview

This agent takes a prompt and a scribble as inputs. From those, it generates an image sets it as an output it.

## Requirements

ingescape >= 3.0.4
numpy
transformers
Pillow
pytorch_lightning
torch
opencv-python
requests

## Installation

For the libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For the diffusion model:

```
python3 model_downloader.py
```

## Usage

Run the script using the following command syntax:
`python3 main.py [agent_name] [network_device] [port]`
Replace `[agent_name]`, `[network_device]`, and `[port]` with appropriate values based on your setup.

### Inputs

- **Scribble**: The scribble is received.
- **Prompt**: The prompt is received.

### Outputs

- **image_generated**: The image generated by the model is set as output.

## Network Device Compatibility

Scribbler is designed to work with various network devices. Ensure the network device is correctly specified when running the script.

## Good to know

The model is open source, so it lacks censorship. On the other hand, any model can be used with very little effort. The model is also slow, which is not surprising considering its size. It takes about 20 seconds to generate an image.
